## Problem Statement
Mental health disorders represent one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease, yet their distribution, prevalence trends, and demographic impacts vary widely across countries and continents. 
Despite growing awareness, there remains limited clarity on how specific disorders—such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance-use disorders—have evolved globally over time. 
This lack of clear insight makes it difficult for policymakers, healthcare organizations, and global health agencies to allocate resources effectively, prioritize interventions, and anticipate emerging mental health challenges.
