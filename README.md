# Mental Health Trend

## Problem Statement
Mental health disorders represent one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease, yet their distribution, prevalence trends, and demographic impacts vary widely across countries and continents. 
Despite growing awareness, there remains limited clarity on how specific disorders—such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance-use disorders—have evolved globally over time. 
This lack of clear insight makes it difficult for policymakers, healthcare organizations, and global health agencies to allocate resources effectively, prioritize interventions, and anticipate emerging mental health challenges.

## Aim
To analyze and visualize global trends in mental health disorders over time, highlighting regional differences, disorder-specific prevalence patterns, and population-adjusted disease burdens to support data-driven mental health policy, intervention planning, and resource allocation.

## Key Objectives
- Quantify and compare the prevalence of major mental disorders—including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, etc across countries and continents.
- Analyze how disorder prevalence has shifted over time and identify regions experiencing growing or declining trends.
- Examine global and regional changes in DALYs attributable to mental disorders.
- Evaluate how the burden varies between populations and continents.
- Map countries and continents with the highest prevalence or DALY burden.
- Determine which disorders contribute most significantly to mental health challenges in each region.
- Normalize prevalence and DALYs using population data to understand true per-capita burden.
- Compare small-population vs. large-population countries objectively.
- Provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, NGOs, and public health professionals.
